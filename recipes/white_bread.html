    <p>It is very easy and doesn't take long to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Dissolve sugar in warm water in a large bowl, and then stir in yeast.
        Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Mix oil and salt into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.</li>
      <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth</li>
      <li>
        Place in a well-oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp
        cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Punch dough down.</li>
      <li>
        Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and
        place into two well-oiled 9x5-inch loaf pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
