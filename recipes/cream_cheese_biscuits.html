      These cream cheese biscuits are tender, fluffy, and slightly sweet, with a
      hint of tangy buttermilk, and they are very delicious.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon cold whole buttermilk, divided
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
      <li>4 ounces cold cream cheese, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a
        large bowl until combined. Add butter and cream cheese and mix in with a
        pastry cutter or two forks until mixture is crumbly and resembles a
        coarse meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and gently stir until mixture
        resembles a shaggy, slightly sticky dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to
        combine. Lightly coat hands and rolling pin with flour; gently pat and
        roll dough to 3/4-inch-thickness, adding more flour as needed to keep
        dough from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a 3-inch biscuit cutter, dipping biscuit cutter in flour between
        cuts, to cut into 12 biscuits, rerolling dough scraps once. Place
        biscuits onto prepared baking sheet about 3/4-inch apart. Brush tops of
        biscuits with remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Serve
        warm.
